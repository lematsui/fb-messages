Haha
Nirm has become so much worse
I don't know how
Although
He used to ONLY play carrys

So maybe that's why
That's cos we don't let him play carry

No we do if he wants it
Actually remember his sniper mid
I think he just doesn't care
Which is fine haha
At least he doesn't think he's a god like Ellis

11 JAN 2019, 04:38
Just watched like an hour and 10 minutes of that rubick video
Quite good lol
What does he say
It's just one of his normal guides really
Like with other heroes
Jus discusses spell amp a lot
Because of the new spell
And matchups
And how to steal the spell you actually want
And what spells to keep
And which to not
This is you to me when you have some wacky idea
11 JAN 2019, 14:44
Other way round fella

You know how
Some old people
Just stop giving a shit
Cause they're old
And they're like
Whatever
And they say whatever
That's gonna be me one day
Epic bro
In fact will probably happen very soon
Immenently
Imminently
Next few days probs
Look out
http://vm.tiktok.com/J7EXXP/
ahhaa
unfortunately the tag #gnome
gave it away
http://vm.tiktok.com/J7WAev/
AHha
the anger
on his face
lovely undertale music
Hahahaha
I love the gnome one
it's great
Toby fox made all the music for undertale himself
And the music is amazing
Masterpiece
True artist
You've told me this before
Definitely
Also I know megalovania is a massive meme
But it's so good
Not as good as
Yakuza 0
Undertale is one of the best games ever made
Ocarina of time
Undertale
Yakuza 0
(Power gap)
Everything else
I have it installed by the way
Hahhaha
Wow not even Majora's Mask which you're DYING to buy
I told you
I bought it
Actually I think my mic wasn't on yet
When I said that
Oh
22 pounds
Pre owned ebay
Should have been 32
Its still worth like 35 40 new
It's actually MAD how 3DS games just
Hold their value
No
Mario Kart 7 is still like 30 quid
It's just good Nintendo games
At CEX preowned
It's the same for Wii u
And switch
The good Mario and Zelda games
And similar Nintendo stuff
Never drop
Yeah but 3DS is so old
Thing is
Although it seems clearer
With 3ds ones
It's just Nintendo's weird supply and demand thing
Like there's like
Not enough of them
But also there kind of is
Hard to explain
But ocarina of time 3ds
Is only 15 pounds now
To buy new
Because they brought Out a Nintendo select version
What's that
Doesn't mean anything
And they changed nothing
So I'm confused as you are haha
Lol
Just like a
This game is epic
So rerelease
And restock
It's like when they used to release like
Platinum edition PS2 games
Yeah
Kind of like goty
But no dlc
Okay so
The reason is just like
They sell a game really really well
And then obviously it stops selling as much after a few years
So they just rerelease it
At like half the price brand new
And remarket it a bit
And get loads of money
Epic weeeeen
Pretty much stealing the idea for arijunk lite
Feel like my spine is fucked
Need a new chair
Gnight
Night
12 JAN 2019, 13:41
How come you're awake
Before 4pm
Your designated wake time

Almost added that to my story by mistake
Would have been a happy accident
Hahahaha
12 JAN 2019, 16:15
Yakuza zero has 2 player online stuff
Like poker and stuff
I know you love poker
Ok
This is epic
Have you played any of it yet
Just on the first cutsxene

And he's like
I dont know
Haha
Oh I thought he was trying to say

I love VIMEO
Is that an editor job or something
it's like a marketing thing
there was this job I saw
that was another one
like a graduate one
and it's
Graduate SEO executive
so like search engine optimization
and you like learn it on the job
Get Jump the Gun to the top
crazy that that's like a whole job
probably more than a job
cause there would be loads of people doing it
I know a guy whose whole job it was to be the MANAGER of an SEO department
For Coral betting
such a large amount
of the graduate jobs
are lik e
you end up being a manager after the course ends
and stuff
they're difficult to get on probs
but quite cool
What even is Auto Chess
We should play it
it's quite confusing
but yes
actually
it would be much easier
if I explained
Had 100k concurrent players today
BIG GAME
yeah
Stunning London-based offices with on-site bar, cafe and roof terrace
shit like this
really pulls me in
I'm a massive sucker haha
Hahahaha
like there's one I have open in a tab
that's like a london one
and they have a "free bar"
lol
When I went for that apprenticeship
To the interviews
They had a free bar
Was cool but the vibe of the place felt a bit off
I dunno
Maybe it's just cos they rejected me
I'm saying that
ahha
I can definitely see that
being the case
like they do give off a very weird vibe
I kind of dislike it
but I like it far more
than like
a stupid normal office
the price to pay is
it being a bit weird
and them saying "how much money do you want!"
and being weird aha
Hmm
Ryan the lion asks what videos to react to on YouTube

Wish I did the videos for DG
Cause I'd just be like
Okay so for this bit
Bladee and ecco need to do the shoot dance
Yep got it great
I'm sure they'd love that
Ahhaha
Maybe
If I keep making fan music videos
For dg
They will hire me
Haha
If they're REALLY good haha
Somehow I doubt it
I don't think anyone other than Ecco does the videos
He'll take me under his wing
Ecco jr
Ecco 200
Earlier today
I was watching something or something
And randomly though
Thought
Could move to america one day
And then just randomly thought
Nah I can't
Cause I'd be too far from the boys in Sweden haha
Sweden/london
Hahaha
Obviously I have 1000 other reasons
But that just sprung to mind
They live in London I'm pretty sure
But you'd still be too far
Yeah
Thats why I said /lodnon
London
I see that now
Joining the essarae discord
Already infuriated
Might have to leave
I'm gonna be so gassed when they break up
Haha
I can actually see myself being sad for her
Cause she'd be so upset ahha
CANT BELEIVE IM CATBCONG DEELING
FEELINGS
I don't give a shit
It's for her own good
There's a vc
Right now
With her in it
And like 30 guys
Amazing
I'm in it
Just not talking
But she's talking
And some guy is playing pirates of the Caribbean on piano
Ok I'm gonna join
Did you hear me say that
Or no
What did toy say
You
Damn so you didn't
Probs just didn't hear
"THIS IS THE WHITEST DISCORD CHANNEL I'VE EVER BEEN IN"
Didn't hear that
I'm in the scribblio
On my laptop lol
Just want to win
So she says my name
Thats the goal
ROFL
You need to record it hahaha
It filled up so fast
Her saying your name
And I'm in
And she's not in
Rofo
Rofl
And the guys are like "it's first come first serve!"
And she's like 'it's not loadinngg'
And some Guy's like 'wait we didn't even get the girl in here??'
It's so funny haha
And she's like
'It be like that 😞 '
Oh she's in now somehow I think
We just kicking random people
So she can join
She's here
Lads
Look who's winning
Fuck overtaken
This guy just finishes his drawing and then write N I G
And stops and Ess is just yelling 'dont. Dont. DONT.'
This is a toaster
And only her and I got it right
Their like " liam's the tea drinker! The redcoat! Fucking English guy thats why he's winning"
Literally proof England is SMARTER
How do they know you're English
Cause Im talking to them
Just left though
It was so funny
I had to draw coast guard and I was doing so badly
And no one was getting it
A d then I made it like red
And half of them got it
A d one guy kept being like " is this some British in joke. Are you mocking us, is this an elaborate joke."
And I was laughing so much ahah
and then someone drew big Ben
And I was the only one to get it for ages
And the guy who drew it's like
Hahahaha
Oh of course the fucking British guy is the only guy to get it
Was just really funny
Had a few interactions with essarae
Life complete
Did you nut
And someone was talking about belle Delphine and I was like I'm from the same city as her pretty much
And this guy was like "WHAT wow. Say hi"
Haha
Hahaha
Not that it wasn't slightly odd
But it just felt far less weird than the peachy one haha
Cause following someone on Instagram and clicking the discord link
Is way less weirder
Than watching a just chatting streamer haha

Hahahaha
Just sittin' here wonderin' what all those rooms with the switches looked like...

your dad is actually smart as hell. ive never heard anyone make the connection between Mew/Mewtwo and "Mutation" but he might be on to something.

people have been theory crafting mewtwo for over 20 years and your dad managed to do better in about 15 seconds. im impressed.﻿

211
dumb comment
what a stupid exaggeration
Rofl
There's a bit at the beginning where he's like what about this one?
